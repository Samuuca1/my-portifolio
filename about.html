                <h2>Hello, everyone!</h2>
                <p>My name is Samuel, I come from Brazil and I am a Humber College Computer Programming student
                    I have always been interested in technology, computers, coding, videogames
                    But I was always to afraid to give it a shot professionally. I am currently
                    a GeorgeBrown College Alumni for Culinary Management, and I have been a Chef
                    for the past 8/9 years. But for more that I love cooking, I started to notice
                    that the lifestyle wasnt aligning with my ideas of future that I wanted to offer
                    for my family and kids.

                    I am also a Model on the side and I have been in a couple commercials and magazine covers.
                    It is a fun job to have but very unstable.

                    I am really enjoying my new path with computer programming and I am doing my
                    very best to learn and be the best I can be at coding.
